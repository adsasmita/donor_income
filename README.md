# donor_income

A machine learning project using [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Python library

## Files

Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

To open the main code, simply open [`donor_income.ipynb`](https://github.com/adsasmita/boston_housing/blob/master/boston_housing.ipynb) on any desktop browser, or you can download and run the cells in a Python 2 environment. The code is presented in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) / iPython notebook for readability purposes.

Visualization codes are contained in [`visuals.py`](https://github.com/adsasmita/boston_housing/blob/master/visuals.py)

## Overview

The Boston housing market is highly competitive and saturated. Suppose that we want to be the best real estate agents in the area. To compete with other agents, we decided to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to determine the best selling price for their home. Luckily, we came across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. We decided to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. The model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for our clients' homes.

This project will also evaluate the performance and predictive power of the model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value.

This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

## Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

The dataset used in this project is included as `housing.csv`. The dataset originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.
